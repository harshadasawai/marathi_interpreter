What's Next:
Now that this test case works, you can expand your interpreter to include other functionalities, like:

Loops (e.g., while or for loops).
Support for more data types (e.g., strings, floats).
Additional control flow like nested if-else statements, function declarations, etc.
Let me know if you'd like to implement any new features or need help with the next steps!
